\section{Course elements}
\begin{description}
\item[L: Lectures] The lectures provide an overview of the literature. They do not cover every detail, but give a high-level structure of the subject and thereby aid self-studies of the literature. Discussions are promoted.
\item[E: Exercises] The main objective of the exercises is to support the project and prepare for the written exam through prototypical problems, by connecting theory to practice and to give opportunity to discuss details of RE techniques.
\item[LAB: Computer lab sessions] The lab sessions illustrate computer supported
prioritization and release planning, and demonstrates the complexity of requirements selection and scheduling. Preparations are mandatory. 
\item[P: Project] The project is carried out in groups of 4-6 students. The project involves a number of deliverables and a final project conference where the learning outcome of each project is presented. Project groups are established during the first course week. Project assignments are established during the second course week.
\end{description}




\section{Assessment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project is graded fail/3/4/5 based on project deliverables.
\item Approved lab session preparations and assignments are required for passing.
\item The written exam comprises 100 points. The pass limit is 50 points.
\item It is optional to hand in two sets of candidate exam problems. Good candidate exam problems can give a maximum of 10 bonus points added to the result of the written exam if they are handed in before stipulated deadlines. The bonus can be used at written exams within 10 months after the course ending.
\item The final course grade on the scale fail/3/4/5 is based on the written exam points including bonus and the project grade using the following mapping:

\begin{tabular}{r | c c c}
 & Project: 3 & Project: 4 & Project: 5 \\
\hline
 & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Exam points + bonus}    \\
Final: 3 & $ \geq 50$ & $\geq 50$ & $\geq 50$ \\
Final: 4 & $ \geq 75$ & $\geq 67$ & $\geq 60$ \\
Final: 5 & $ \geq 90$ & $\geq 83$ & $\geq 75$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\noindent All deliverables should have a title, version number, team id (capital letter), system name and names of the project members. 

\subsubsection{Project Mission v1}

Acting as customer your team should prepare an initial version of a Project Mission for a development team. The Project Mission defines the system for which the employed project will elicit, prioritize, specify and validate requirements.

 \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
 \item The Project Mission should fit on {\bf one A4 page} be in .pdf format for easy printing and web publishing. 
 \item The Project Mission should include a descriptive project name as well as the names of its authors.


\item You should fulfill the following criteria regarding the system you propose:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item You have a deep understanding of the application domain 
\item You have a genuine interest in the system 
\item You are be able to assess the value of detailed requirements 
\end{enumerate}
\item In the Project Mission you should state which one of the following customer roles that you would like to play:
\begin{description}[noitemsep]
\item [Key Customer] Your team acts as one of many potential customer on an assumed market for the envisioned product. The development team owns the product and decides on priorities and product content, while your team gives input and provides feedback. 
\item [Product Owner] You as a customer team is planning to sell the product yourself in an envisioned future. The development team is subcontracted to do requirements engineering only. Your team decides on priorities and scope. 
\end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Project Mission v2}
Acting as developer your team should prepare a second version of the Project Mission where the scope of the project is further defined in dialog with your customer and supervisor. 
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item The Project Mission v2 is recommended to include the following information:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item Table of contents
 \item Background and other information from Project Mission v1 
 \item	Main goals and system context
 \item	Participants and potential stakeholders 
 \item	Description of planned activities and deliverables with deadlines
 \item	Diagram showing the planned time per week and participant 
 \item	Responsibilities of project members 
\end{enumerate}

 \item With the above content it is useful if following questions can be answered:
 \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
 \item          What is the project about?
 \item          Who is participating in the project as members and as input providers?
 \item          What should be done in the project?
 \item          When should the results be delivered?
 \item          Who is responsible for what?
 \item          When shall who work with what?
 \item		What will the customer team spend their time on? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Deliverables}
 \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
\item You should work iteratively and divide your work into 3 main iterations, each ending with a release with all your accumulated work products. (You  may have more sub-iterations with additional team-internal releases.)
\item The releases are denoted R1, R2 and R3.
\item For each release, the quality of your deliverables should represent a noticeable improvement.
\item Each release should be divided into two explicit parts: {\bf System Requirements} and {\bf Project Experiences}, each with its own {\bf table of contents}.
\item There should be an {\bf overview description} of each release to make navigation and assessment  easy, e.g. in a file called \verb+index.html+ or \verb+README.txt+.
\item A release \verb+Rn+ of team \verb+X+ should be delivered in {\it one single, self-contained} {\bf zip-file} named \verb+X-Rn.zip+ including {\it all} deliverables. If the file is too big to email then provide a http link to a downloadable zip-file.

\item Each deliverable may link to further resources such as html pages, pdf documents, screen images, text files, executables, etc., all contained in the delivered zip file. No external links outside the zip is allowed.

\item The last release R3 should include final versions of: System Requirements, Project Experiences, Validation Report \& Checklist (final versions by R2 also copied into R3), and Conference Presentation. Course Evaluation is delivered post course.

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
 \item[System Requirements] including the following information:  
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
 \item Different types of system requirements (e.g. data, function, quality) at different levels (e.g. goal, domain, product, design).
 \item Several different specification techniques (e.g. context diagrams, features, virtual windows, task descriptions).
\item Each requirement should have a unique identity (name or number). 
 \item A subset of the requirements should be prioritized.
  \item A subset of the requirements should be implemented as mock-up designs (e.g. screens and prototypes, analog drawings, clickable presentations, executable gui mockups).   
  \item A subset of the requirements should be release planned. The release planning information should define which requirements that are implemented by the development team as mock-up designs in release R3, and which requirements are selected to be fully implemented in the imagined releases R4 and R5. 
\end{enumerate}

 \item[Project Experiences] including the following information: 
   \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
   \item a description of your requirements engineering work, including experiences and reflections in relation to learning objectives.
 \item Description of the chosen methods/techniques for elicitation, specification, validation, and prioritization.
  \item Motivation for {\it why} you chose the used methods/techniques. 
 \item Reflection on  the usage of these methods/techniques in terms of what was successful and what was challenging. Example questions for reflection: What have you learned in relation to the learning objectives in this course program? What would you have done differently if you would do this project again as a ''real'' project, based on what you know now?  What have you learned in relation to the learning objectives?
 \item A personal statement by each team member that briefly explains each individual's contributions to the project results.
  \item The Project Experiences should {\it not} include course evaluation issues, but focus on your own work and learning outcome. 
  \end{enumerate}


\item[Validation Report] Acting as customer, you should validate release R2 from the other development team  and hand in your validation report together with your team's R2. Your team should produce relevant and useful issues for improvement. Each issue should be ranked for criticality.
 \item[Validation Checklist]  Acting as developer you should provide your customer with a requirements validation checklist tailored to the context.


\item[Conference Presentation]
Prepare and rehearse a short presentation.
   \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
 \item The total presentation time and further guidelines are given during the course.
 \item Spend approx. 10\% of the presentation time on the project's mission.
 \item Spend approx. 45\% of the time on project results and techniques used.
 \item Spend approx. 45\% of the time on experiences and learning outcome.
 \item Slides should be in \{.ppt|.pptx|.pdf\}.
\end{enumerate}


\item[Course Evaluation] (Not part of assessment.) A separate, free-form Course Evaluation document should be handed in by the team. If team members have different views, it is valuable if these differences are reflected. For each relevant course element (L, E, LAB, P, etc.) answer questions such as: What worked well?  If something needs improvement, {\it why} and {\it how} would you like it to be changed? 

 \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Project assessment}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item The deliverables Project Mission and Conference Presentation is pass/fail only.
\item The project grade of fail/3/4/5 is based on Release R3 and your Validation Report \& Checklist according to the criteria in the table on the next page: 

%\item Approx. $\frac{1}{2}$ of the grade is based on the {\bf System Requirements} in R3.
%\item Approx. $\frac{1}{3}$ of the grade is based on the {\bf Project Experiences} in R3.
%\item Approx. $\frac{1}{6}$ of the grade is based on the customer {\bf Validation Report} of R2.
